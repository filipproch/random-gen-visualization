### Usage

#### Option 1 - arguments
In the first option, you have to pass numbers as arguments (integers, 2 digits). This is also only way to get graphical output.
```
java -jar app.jar ## ## ## ...
```
replace ## with actual 2 digit integers

also the generated series of pseudo-random numbers will be stored in file called "vystup.txt" ("vystup" is a czech word for output)

#### Option 2 - input file
In the second option, the input is from a text file. You enter the name of the file after the execution (the program should ask for it).
The file should contain again a set of 2 digit integers, one on each line. The resulting series are then printed into the terminal window.
```
java -jar app.jar

input.txt
```
